# Agent Skill Best Practices Checklist

- [ ] **Routing**: Is the `description` in YAML a clear, semantic trigger?
- [ ] **Context Efficiency**: Are large blocks of text moved to `resources/`?
- [ ] **Structure**: Does it have the required directory/file structure?
- [ ] **Logic**: Is complex logic delegated to `scripts/`?
- [ ] **Constraints**: Are there clear "Do Not" rules?
- [ ] **Scope**: Is it appropriately placed (Global vs Workspace)?
- [ ] **Instructions**: Are the steps clear and easy for an agent to follow?
