# build-skill.sh — package the watch skill as a claude.ai-upload-ready .skill file.
# Usage: bash skills/watch/scripts/build-skill.sh   (run from anywhere)
#
# Produces dist/watch.skill, a zip with a single top-level `watch/` directory
# containing SKILL.md and the scripts/ runtime from skills/watch. Archiving the
# skills/watch subtree directly keeps the bundle to exactly one SKILL.md and
# well under claude.ai's 200-file cap, with no post-hoc `zip -d` stripping.
