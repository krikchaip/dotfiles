  If you don't know anything about Lua, I recommend taking some time to read through
  a guide. One possible example which will only take 10-15 minutes:
    - https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua

  After understanding a bit more about Lua, you can use `:help lua-guide` as a
  reference for how Neovim integrates Lua.
    - :help lua-guide
    - (or HTML version): https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html

  If you experience any errors while trying to install plugins,
  run `:checkhealth` for more info. for example `:checkhealth telescope`
